# Introduction

In this hands-on tutorial, we will take a look at how we can use Kotlin/JS with the popular framework [React](https://reactjs.org/) to build a first, modern reactive web app.
React lets us build web applications quickly, with a focus on component reuse and management of the application state.
It is supported by a large ecosystem of community-created materials and components.

We will get to reuse our knowledge about Kotlin's language paradigms, syntax, and tooling to build front-end applications for modern browsers.

In this hands-on, we will learn how to build our first application with Kotlin/JS and React.
We will go through the usual tasks associated with building a typical, simple React application.

We will explore how [Kotlin's DSLs](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/type-safe-builders.html) can be used to help us write our app completely in Kotlin.
We will also reuse some ready-made components created by the community, make use of external libraries, and see how to publish our final application.

You're expected to have a basic knowledge of Kotlin, and a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.
Prior knowledge of the basic concepts behind React is helpful in understanding some of samples, but is not strictly required.

### What we are going to build

The annual [*KotlinConf*](https://kotlinconf.com/) is the event to visit if you want to learn more about Kotlin and exchange with the community.
With 1300 attendees and a ton of workshops and sessions, KotlinConf 2018 offered a wealth of information, much of which is still valuable to this very day!
For anyone needing to still catch up, all the videos are available on YouTube!

The project that we will create throughout this tutorial - *KotlinConf Explorer* - will allow users to get an overview of the talks, quickly mark them as *seen* or *unseen*, and watch them all from one page: perfect for a Kotlin-binge-session!

You can find the source code of the final application as well as the intermediate steps on the corresponding [GitHub](https://github.com/kotlin-hands-on/web-app-react-kotlin-js-gradle) repository. Each step is available from its own branch, and is linked at the bottom of each corresponding section.

Let's start by setting up our development environment to get up and running.
