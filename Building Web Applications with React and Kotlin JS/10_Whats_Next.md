# What's next

### Feature requests

Obviously, our demo application could do with some improvements.
Feel free to use it as a jumping-off point to explore more advanced topics about React, Kotlin/JS, and friends.

##### Search

It would be interesting if you could filter the list of talks by title or author.
To do so, learn about how [HTML form elements work in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html).

##### Persistence

Every time our app gets loaded, it loses track of the viewer's watch list.
Consider building your own backend,
using one of the web frameworks available for Kotlin (like [Ktor](https://ktor.io/)).
Alternatively, look into ways of [storing information on the client](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage). 

##### Complex APIs

There's a wonderful world out there, full of datasets and APIs to be explored. Why not try building a visualizer for [cat photos](https://thecatapi.com/)? Or enrich your life with a [royalty-free stock photo API](https://unsplash.com/developers)? There's no shortage of data you'll be able to pull into your application.

### Better style: Responsiveness and grids

The design of the application is still very simple, and won't look great on mobile devices or in narrow windows.
Explore some more of the CSS DSL, and make it look pretty!

### Community, help and troubleshooting

The best way to report problems
and get help is the [kotlin-wrappers issue tracker](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-wrappers/issues).
If you can't find your problem, do not hesitate to file a new issue.
You can also join the official [Kotlin Slack](https://surveys.jetbrains.com/s3/kotlin-slack-sign-up).
There, you can join the `#javascript` and `#react` channels.

### Learning more about coroutines

We've only touched the surface of the powerful concepts that make coroutines worth using across your applications. If you're interested in finding out more about how you can write concurrent code, check out the hands-on lab on [coroutines](https://play.kotlinlang.org/hands-on/Introduction%20to%20Coroutines%20and%20Channels/01_Introduction)!

### Learning more about React

The [official guides on React](https://reactjs.org/docs/) are quite plentiful and well-written. Now that you've been exposed to the basic concepts and how they translate to Kotlin, you'll hopefully have an easy time converting some of the other concepts outlined in the official guides into Kotlin, and may even become a React-Kotlin-Master!
