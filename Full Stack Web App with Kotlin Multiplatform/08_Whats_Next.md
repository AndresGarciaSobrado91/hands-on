# What's next

### Feature requests

For a basic shopping list, we've ticked most of the important boxes – but it's not hard to see how our application could still be expanded and improved.

- **Make it pretty!** While very functional, our application so far doesn't look like much. You could make use of `styled-components`, one of the libraries that has Kotlin wrappers provided. If you want to see `styled-components` in action, have a look at the [Building Web Applications with React and Kotlin/JS](https://play.kotlinlang.org/hands-on/Building%20Web%20Applications%20with%20React%20and%20Kotlin%20JS/01_Introduction) Hands-on!
- **Don't just delete – cross it out!** For now, list items just vanish when you're done with them – with no record of them ever existing in the first place. A distinction could be made between "deleting" an element and "~~crossing out~~" and element.
- **Make 'em updatable!** So far, an entry in our shopping list can't be edited. Maybe an 'edit' button might be an interesting addition?
